Pull the source code

Run the class App.java to input parameters source vertices start and target, and 1 for BFS and 0 for DFS

CompareSearchAlgorithm.java randomly selects 40 randomly selected source/ target vertices and runs BFS and DFS on them.

AppTest.java runs the test cases on the DFS and BFS algorithm for specific graphs

Usage:

mvn clean install to build the package
